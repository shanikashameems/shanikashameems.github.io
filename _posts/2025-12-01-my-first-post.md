title: My First Blog Post
---

Today I created my own personal blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll 🎉

I’m Shanika, a CSE student who loves AI, web development and building cool things like ByteTree.

From now on, I’ll try to write small posts every day about:

- What I learned in tech (AI, ML, web, etc.)
- Projects and internships I’m working on
- College experiences and random thoughts

This blog is not about perfection. It’s about **showing my journey** and growing in public 💙
