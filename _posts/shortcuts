1️⃣ Headings (MOST IMPORTANT)
# Main Title (already comes from front matter usually)
## Section heading
### Sub-section
#### Small point


👉 Use ## and ### mostly.
Don’t go beyond #### in blogs — looks messy.

2️⃣ Bold, Italic, Bold+Italic
**bold text**
*italic text*
***bold + italic***


Use bold to highlight ideas, not entire paragraphs.

3️⃣ Horizontal Divider (Very useful)
---


Creates a clean section break. Use it often.

4️⃣ Bullet Points
- point one
- point two
- point three


Nested bullets:

- main point
  - sub point
  - sub point

5️⃣ Numbered Lists
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

6️⃣ Quotes / Thoughts
> This is a thought or reflection.


Use this for opinions, realizations, lessons.

7️⃣ Inline Code (Tech blogs NEED this)
`print("Hello World")`


Perfect for variables, functions, commands.
