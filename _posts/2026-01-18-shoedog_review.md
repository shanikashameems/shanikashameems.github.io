title: SHOE DOG by Phil Knight
---

This is one of the books in my stack that changed my idea about my life. Usually whenever I read a book, I focus on the takeaways from the book and this book is one 
of the finest books ever.

Its by *Phil Knight* the Co-Founder and Former CEO of NIKE.

### Why I call it finest:
  - [ ] He started his brand with nothing but a clear motive to produce something which has not been in the market for so long
  - [ ] He believed in *tell poeple what to do and let them surprise you with their results*
  - [ ] He never stopped even when he had a doubt
  - [ ] He never blamed people who chose others of higher status(so called)
  - [ ] He knew that *family* has to be prioritized

This book is something that everybody tryna build something must read. It juts changed the idea of why and what.
> you are remembered for the rules you break
> Pay Nissho first


And with 386 pages to be eaxct, the way he handled his family, business, friendships, regrets, temptations, anger, humbleness, and most importantly the thought of quitting was all worth it
>get one too!!
