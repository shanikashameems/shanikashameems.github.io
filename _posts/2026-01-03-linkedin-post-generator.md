title: LinkedIn Post Generator

The problem is simple: you dont feel to post coz you dont have the right content
So i simplified this by creating a linkedin post generator

### The Workflow:
  - you give your account's previous post captions or give in the captions of your fav one's account
  - this captions are feeded to the model to train on and then understand the language of the user(i used langchain here)
  - then an api key is integrated to make the ai do the generations (here i used groq api key)
  - then a good looking ui is developed using streamlit with options like title, length and language

this is my first project using api keys and groq is something which i consider easier to start with
though its a simple project it thought me a lot:
    - using api keys
    - why langchain is preferred
    - simple ui development with streamit

and the core thing is that i developed without any copy paste - meaning i used learn and apply trick
i understand it is slow process but works!!!
