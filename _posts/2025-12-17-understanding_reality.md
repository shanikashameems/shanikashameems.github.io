So i just learnt a very good thing today that no matter how much you try if you still procrastinate you cannot really achieve what you actually want!

Nothing much I just went through my schedule for the vacay and i didnt complete a single one...... WOW actually WOW!!

I am a procrastinator but today the reality hits!

So i made myself a promise today that the next 7 days will be the best times of my life
got some project ideas to build with

# linkedin post generator
# an ai chatbot

# project 1 is meant to be completed by tomorrow
# second is not planned yet

i just realised that if you have a **strong basics** you are half way there!

so im focussing on my ****basics****!!!!
