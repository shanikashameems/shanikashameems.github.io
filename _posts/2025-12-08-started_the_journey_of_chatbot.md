## today i started working on building my own chatbot

the concept is simple 
chatbot can be built so easily using ai tools but why i wanna do it on my own is to understand how things actually work

the core components are a little confusing as a beginner
all you need is good enough knowledge on these three things

  - front end
  - backend
  - database
for frontend the easiest way is to use ai and that is what im gonna do
for backend im gonna use python- which i have to learn
for database im gonna start with the simplest MySQL - which i have a good enough knowledge on

That is all for today!!
